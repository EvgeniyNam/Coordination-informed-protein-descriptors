# Coordination-informed-protein-descriptors
The protein drug market is extremely expanding. It is estimated to reach almost four billion dollars by 2028. At the same time, the share of biopharmaceuticals on the market is also growing from year to year. 
Such growth is associated with significant selectivity and efficiency of protein drugs, which are explained by their unique configurations - protein structures folding.

Today exist two approaches: structure- and sequence-based models. In sequence-based models a protein is represented by a symbolic sequence of amino acids. In the structure-based models a protein is represented as a set of geometry characteristics – atoms coordinates and distances between them. 

But both methods have a big common disadvantage - they do not take into account chemical and coordination interactions. Due to this fact, they are not effective enough, their use does not have a strong impact on the cost of research.

But Protein folding and therefore their properties depend not only on sequence but also on coordination by other compounds. And Bivalent ions have shown to play crucial roles in these processes. In particular, calcium and magnesium cations, which are widely represented in the living organisms

That’s why we decided to develop new method to describe proteins in ML thorough coordination-informed descriptors.  

We offer descriptive characteristics based on chemical interactions approach.
Our method relies on the interactions of dipeptides with calcium and magnesium cations; proteins are described as an intersecting sequence of dipeptides. As the result we will obtain the set of digital characteristics for any protein. Moreover, the set sizes will be the same for protein of any length
